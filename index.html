			<h1>Work</h1>

			<p class="note">
				Most of my work is still based on Cases of Study (for now). Interesting stuff I have seen and, somehow, recreated my way. I love testing new things, challenging myself to do whatever others have done and innovating new techniques.
			</p>

			<p class="note">
				Next you can see six examples of my work. Only the second is web full responsive. I simply did not want to merge more than one thing at the same time during my learning process. I think this way of thinking has helped me.
			</p>

			<div id="work-list">
				<div class="work-instance odd-instance">
					<h2 class="work-header">Simple Board Game</h2>
					<p class="work-note">JavaScript programmatically generated markup with pseudo-random number generation. You can see it <a href="http://aespinet.fvi-grad.com/board-game/">here</a></p>
				</div>

				<div class="work-instance even-instance">
					<h2 class="work-header">Responsive design with Flexbox</h2>
					<p class="work-note">Full responsive page using pure CSS and flexbox in a very Star Wars manner. You can see it <a href="http://aespinet.fvi-grad.com/jedi-culture/">here</a></p>
				</div>

				<div class="work-instance odd-instance">
					<h2 class="work-header">Memory Game</h2>
					<p class="work-note">JavaScript and CSS based classic memory game. The art was fully obtained from internet, so please don't hurt me. You can see it <a href="http://aespinet.fvi-grad.com/memory-card-game/">here</a></p>
				</div>

				<div class="work-instance even-instance">
					<h2 class="work-header">Basic canvas animation</h2>
					<p class="work-note">A very simple animation made using HTML5 Canvas. Look a bit close and you will find out that Earth also rotates. You can see it <a href="http://aespinet.fvi-grad.com/canvas-practice/">here</a></p>
				</div>

				<div class="work-instance odd-instance">
					<h2 class="work-header">Virtual Store</h2>
					<p class="work-note">My first approach to Materialize framework. This project is not completed, because the goal was not doing the whole site, but testing a new tool to see if I could include it in my toolset. I liked the results. You can see it <a href="http://aespinet.fvi-grad.com/virtual-store/">here</a></p>
				</div>

				<div class="work-instance even-instance">
					<h2 class="work-header">Forest Ninja vs Aliens</h2>
					<p class="work-note">Android app. This is a minigame I created a weekend I was pretty bored. It is made in Unity3D, and the assets were some downloaded from internet, some created by me, and some first downloaded and then modified. You can download the app from (it's secure, do not worry) <a href="https://mega.nz/#!zhRCjaCD!4_VFMuO9qZ_BHhLBwNDfxZOdMtnWc6h-gzH0Ub6zpXM">here</a>. Now, if you just want to see a sample video of the app running in my phone, you can go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl2CAkpDtOc">this link</a>. Yes, the music is from Naruto.</p>

			<p class="note">
				Obviously I pretend to have more examples here, bit firts I would like to create really good stuff, not only cases of study...

			<h1>About</h1>

				I have always been a guy that enjoys programming and developing, and in order to create better products every day, I spend a lot of time studying, investigating and learning. I am not afraid if I have to push myself to my very limits; neither I am if I have to work under pressure. I simply love what I do. Now...
			</p>

			<p class="note question">
				-Are you looking for a deeply focus developer?
			</p>

			<p class="note question">
				-Are you perhaps trying to find a person with a high sense of responsibility and willingly to work, work and work?
			</p>
